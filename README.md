In this exercise you learn the basics of the command line.

First, create a `star_wars` directory and go there.

**Note:** Each file (not directory/folder) you create should be a *text file*. This means the file will end with the extension of `*.txt`. For example: `jimbo_jones.txt`

###### Act I

* In your `star_wars` folder, create two new directories: `empire` and `rebellion`.
* Inside the `empire` directory, create a .txt file called `darth_vader`
* Use the force (or your knowledge of the command line) to add the text "...heavy breathing..." to the `darth_vader` file.
* Inside the empire directory, create a .txt file called `emperor_palpatine`.
* Inside the empire directory, create a directory called `death_star`
* Move `darth_vader` into the `death_star`

###### Act II

* Move back to your `star_wars` directory, and enter the `rebellion` directory
* Create a file called `princess_leia` and add the text 'Help me, Obi-Wan...You're my only hope.'
* Create a file called `obi_wan`
* Create a file called `luke_skywalker`
* Create a directory called `millenium_falcon`
* Inside the `millenium_falcon`, create two files: `han_solo` and `chewy`
* Move `luke_skywalker`, `obi-wan`, and `princess_leia` into the `millenium_falcon`
* Move the `millenium_falcon` into the `death_star`

###### Act III

* Unload the Millenium Falcon! Move the whole crew from the `millenium_falcon` directory into the `death_star` directory
* Darth_vader has defeated obi_wan! Delete poor `obi_wan`
* Our heroes have disabled the tractor beam! Move the whole crew back into the millenium_falcon!
* Move the `millenium_falcon` back into the `rebellion` directory
* darth_vader leaves the death_star to pursue Luke! Move him from the death_star into the empire directory!
* Thanks to his practice back home at Beggar's Canyon, Luke blew up the death star! Remove it from the galaxy!
* You win!
